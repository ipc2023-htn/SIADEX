%setup
     ## The "%setup"-part of this script is called to bootstrap an empty
     ## container. It copies the source files from the branch of your
     ## repository where this file is located into the container to the
     ## directory "/planner". Do not change this part unless you know
     ## what you are doing and you are certain that you have to do so.

    #REPO_ROOT=`dirname $SINGULARITY_BUILDDEF`
    #cp -r $REPO_ROOT/ $SINGULARITY_ROOTFS/planner

%post

    ## The "%post"-part of this script is called after the container has
    ## been created with the "%setup"-part above and runs "inside the
    ## container". Most importantly, it is used to install dependencies
    ## and build the planner. Add all commands that have to be executed
    ## once before the planner runs in this part of the script.

    ## Install all necessary dependencies.
    apt-get update
    apt-get -y install make cmake flex bison python-dev-is-python3 libreadline-dev g++

    ## go to directory and make the planner
    cd /planner/planner
    cmake .
    make -j

    ## Build the parser
    cd /planner/parser
    make -j


%runscript
    ## The runscript is called whenever the container is used to solve
    ## an instance.

    DOMAINFILE=$1
    PROBLEMFILE=$2
    PLANFILE=$3

    ## First the HDDL files should be translated
    /planner/parser/pandaPIparser --hpdl -g $DOMAINFILE $PROBLEMFILE domain.hpdl problem.hpdl

    ## Calling the Siadex planner
    stdbuf -o0 -e0 /planner/planner/planner -d domain.hpdl -p problem.hpdl 2>&1 | tee unformatted_plan.txt | tee $PLANFILE

    ## Parsing the output
    python /planner/planner/format_ouput.py unformatted_plan.txt | tee -a $PLANFILE
